# Job Filtering App
## Built using React.js and Styled Components

This is a static job posting site that can be filtered by category/skill if you click on any of the tags on a posting. The filters can then be cleared. 

## Learnings
I thought it was a fun challenge to represent JSON data as a card component that can be interacted with by the user. It was also a challenge applying multiple filters to all of the job postings.
